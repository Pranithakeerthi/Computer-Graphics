FILES:
-----

1. The directory, "1.Midpoint Algorithms", conisists of an html file, "1.html", which consists the html and javascript code to draw line, circle and ellipse in the canvas, implementing the midpoint algorithm.
The code consists of 3 radio buttons, one for line, one for circle and one for ellipse; such that whichever radio button is checked that respective midpoint algorithm is executed and a line is drawn.
The code also has two drop down menu's, one for the thickness of the line and one for color of the border of the line which when choosen draws the line, circle or ellipse in that respective color and thickness.

2. The directory, "2. Rectangles", conisists of an html file, "2.html", which consists the html and javascript code to draw rectangle in the canvas.
The code has four text areas, two for the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate from where the rectangle to start and two for the height and width of the rectangle. 
The code also has two buttons, one for draw and one for clear. The draw button when clicked takes the four values entered in the text area's of X,Y,height and width respectively and then draws the rectangle according to the given inputs.
The code also has two drop down menu's, one for the thickness of the rectangle and one for color of the border of the rectangle which when choosen draws the rectangle in that respective color and thickness.

3. The directory, "3. Polygons", conisists of an html file, "3.html", which consists the html and javascript code to draw polygon in the canvas.
The code has two text areas, one for the number of sides and one for the length of each line in the polygon.
The code also has two buttons, one for draw and one for clear. The draw button when clicked takes the two values entered in the text area's of Number of sides and Enter size respectively and then draws the polygon according to the given inputs.
The code also has two drop down menu's, one for the thickness of the rectangle and one for color of the border of the rectangle which when choosen draws the polygon in that respective color and thickness.

4. The directory, "4. Polylines", conisists of an html file, "4.html", which consists the html and javascript code to draw polylines in the canvas.
The code has two text areas, one for the number of points and one for the length of each line in the polygon.
The code also has two buttons, one for draw and one for clear. The draw button when clicked takes the two values entered in the text area's of Number of points and Enter length respectively and then draws the polylines according to the given inputs.
The code also has two drop down menu's, one for the thickness of the rectangle and one for color of the border of the polylines which when choosen draws the polygon in that respective color and thickness.

5. The directory, "5.Rubberbanding", conisists of an html file, "5.html", which consists the html and javascript code to execute and draw line rubberbanding in the canvas, implementing the midpoint algorithm.
The code also has two drop down menu's, one for the thickness of the line and one for color of the border of the line which when choosen draws the line in that respective color and thickness.
The code when executes draws a line which can be dragged into it's initial place from where it started, rubberbanding.
