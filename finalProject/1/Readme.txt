FILES:
-----

1. The file "1. house.html" consists of a 2D house elevations, i.e. front view, side view and top view.
The file has a link to "2.transform.html" such that when "click here:Transform Object" is clicked it prompts to the transform.html file.

2. The file "2.transform.html" consists of html code to perform transformation of objects on the front,side and top view of the house.
The transformations include translate, rotate, scale, and shear.
Each transformation is set to a min and max value, i.e. translate has a min of 100 and max of 400 which when changed translates the object to that y-axis.
Rotate has a min value of 0 and max value of 360 which when changed rotates the object to that angle along the y-axis.
Scale has a min value 1 and max value of 0.5 change such that when changed the object increase or decrease to the value.
Shear has a min value of 0 and max value of 360 such that when changed it tilts to the value.

FUTURE:
------

The present html files are developed using svg in javascript. 
This 2D assignment is a start for me to gain knowledge about the graphics in 2D perspective which is a start to learn about 3D development.
The 2D elevations is to gain a perspective regarding the 2D views which can be further used to form a whole figure,i.e.,3D object using WebGL.
This 3D object will then be used to apply 3D transformations and other objectives of the project on that specific object.
